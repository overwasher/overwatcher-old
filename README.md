# overwatcher

[NOTICE]: this is a legacy version of the overwatcher, retained for historical purposes. It was rewritten in C# to allow for more testability and maintainability.

Overwatcher component - receives, aggregates and archives sensor node data and provides a nice API to query the current states.
